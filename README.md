Kurikaeshi (Japanese for 'repetition') is an app allowing users to learn and retain Japanese vocabulary by means of a spaced repetition algorithm. Kurikaeshi stores a wealth of information, including pronunciation and example usages, for each word, and tracks the user's progress as their grasp of new vocabulary words increases.
